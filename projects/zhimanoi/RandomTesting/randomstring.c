This is text file that outline how I developed my solution and how it works:

First I looked at what the code does. Then I compiled it and ran the program.
It was an infinite loop. I needed to fill in the two funciont that will help
me terminate the program so that the loop doesn't continue repeating forever.
I needed to use inputChar() funtion to input a random character in a certain
range. The second function that needed to be filled in was inputString. 
This function goes through the loop of randomly generated character or a string. I chose the lengths of the
string to be 6. Then I get a random ASCII character in the certain range.
Now when I run this program and it terminates with:
Iteration 5796251: c = f, s = reset, state = 9
it took about a minute to finish running.
